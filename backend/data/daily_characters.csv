1,Adam,אָדָם,ఆదాము,Man from earth,"First man created by God in His image",Genesis 1:27,"God formed Adam from the dust and breathed life into him","Adam was the first human being, created by God on the sixth day of creation. God formed him from the dust of the ground (adamah) and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils. Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden to tend and keep it. He named all the animals but found no suitable helper among them. God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and created Eve from his rib. Together they lived in perfect fellowship with God until they were deceived by the serpent and ate from the forbidden tree. Despite their fall, God promised a Redeemer through Eve's offspring. Adam lived 930 years.","Genesis 1:26-27|Genesis 2:7|Genesis 2:15-25|Genesis 3:1-24|Genesis 5:1-5|Romans 5:12-21|1 Corinthians 15:45",/characters/adam.png
2,Eve,חַוָּה,హవ్వ,Life,"First woman, mother of all living",Genesis 3:20,"Created from Adam's rib to be his helper and companion","Eve (Chavah) was the first woman, created by God from Adam's rib while he slept in the Garden of Eden. Her name means 'life' or 'living' because she would become the mother of all humanity. Eve was deceived by the serpent's craftiness and ate the forbidden fruit, then gave some to Adam. Though this brought sin and death into the world, God gave Eve the first promise of salvation - that her offspring would crush the serpent's head. She bore Cain, Abel, Seth, and other children. Her story teaches about temptation, consequences of sin, and God's redemptive grace.","Genesis 2:18-25|Genesis 3:1-24|Genesis 4:1-2|Genesis 4:25|2 Corinthians 11:3|1 Timothy 2:13-14",/characters/eve.png
3,Noah,נֹחַ,నోవహు,Rest,"Righteous man who built the ark",Genesis 6:9,"Found favor with God and saved humanity from the flood","Noah was a righteous man who walked with God during the most corrupt era of human history. When God determined to destroy the earth by flood due to humanity's wickedness, Noah found grace in His eyes. God commanded Noah to build an ark 300 cubits long - a task that took approximately 120 years. Noah preached righteousness during this time but only his family of eight believed. He gathered two of every unclean animal and seven of every clean animal as God commanded. The flood lasted 40 days and nights, with waters covering the earth for 150 days. After the waters receded, Noah offered sacrifice, and God established His covenant with the rainbow, promising never to destroy the earth by flood again. Noah lived 950 years.","Genesis 5:28-32|Genesis 6:5-22|Genesis 7:1-24|Genesis 8:1-22|Genesis 9:1-29|Hebrews 11:7|1 Peter 3:20|2 Peter 2:5",/characters/noah.png
4,Abraham,אַבְרָהָם,అబ్రాహాము,Father of many,"Father of faith and the Hebrew nation",Genesis 12:1,"Left his home country trusting God's promise","Abraham (originally Abram) is called the father of faith. God called him from Ur of the Chaldees to leave his country, family, and father's house for a land God would show him. At 75 years old, Abraham obeyed without knowing his destination. God promised him descendants as numerous as the stars and sand, though Sarah was barren. After waiting 25 years, Isaac was born when Abraham was 100. The ultimate test came when God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac - his obedience demonstrated that he feared God above all. God provided a ram as substitute, foreshadowing Christ. Abraham is the father of Jews through Isaac and Arabs through Ishmael. He died at 175 years.","Genesis 12:1-9|Genesis 15:1-21|Genesis 17:1-27|Genesis 18:1-33|Genesis 21:1-8|Genesis 22:1-19|Romans 4:1-25|Hebrews 11:8-19|James 2:21-24",/characters/abraham.png
5,Sarah,שָׂרָה,శారా,Princess,"Mother of Isaac, wife of Abraham",Genesis 17:15,"Laughed at God's promise but gave birth at 90","Sarah (originally Sarai) was Abraham's wife and half-sister. Known for exceptional beauty even in old age, she accompanied Abraham on his journey of faith. Though barren for decades, God promised she would bear a son. When Sarah heard this at age 89, she laughed in disbelief - yet Isaac (meaning 'laughter') was born exactly as God promised. Sarah is the only woman in Scripture whose age at death (127 years) is recorded. The New Testament honors her as an example of faith and submission. Through her faith, the impossible became possible, teaching us that God's promises never fail, regardless of circumstances.","Genesis 11:29-31|Genesis 12:10-20|Genesis 16:1-6|Genesis 17:15-22|Genesis 18:9-15|Genesis 21:1-12|Genesis 23:1-20|Hebrews 11:11|1 Peter 3:6"
6,Isaac,יִצְחָק,ఇస్సాకు,He laughs,"Son of promise to Abraham",Genesis 21:3,"Nearly sacrificed but God provided a ram","Isaac was the miracle child born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age - Abraham was 100 and Sarah 90. His name means 'laughter' because both parents laughed when God foretold his birth. Isaac's near-sacrifice on Mount Moriah is one of the Bible's most powerful foreshadowings of Christ. As Isaac carried the wood for his own sacrifice up the mountain, so Christ carried His cross. At the last moment, God provided a ram caught in a thicket as a substitute - pointing to the Lamb of God. Isaac married Rebekah at 40, and after 20 years of prayer, twins Jacob and Esau were born. Isaac lived 180 years, longer than Abraham or Jacob.","Genesis 17:15-22|Genesis 21:1-8|Genesis 22:1-19|Genesis 24:1-67|Genesis 25:19-26|Genesis 26:1-35|Genesis 27:1-46|Genesis 35:27-29|Hebrews 11:17-20"
7,Jacob,יַעֲקֹב,యాకోబు,Supplanter,"Father of the twelve tribes",Genesis 32:28,"Wrestled with God and was renamed Israel","Jacob, born grasping Esau's heel, lived up to his name 'supplanter' by deceiving his father to obtain Esau's blessing. Fleeing Esau's wrath, he saw the ladder to heaven at Bethel where God renewed the Abrahamic covenant. He worked 14 years for Rachel, the love of his life. Through his two wives and their servants, Jacob fathered 12 sons who became the tribes of Israel. The turning point came at Peniel where he wrestled with God all night and was renamed 'Israel' (he who strives with God). Reconciling with Esau showed his transformation. His favorite son Joseph was sold into slavery but eventually saved the family. Jacob died in Egypt at 147 years, blessing his 12 sons prophetically.","Genesis 25:21-34|Genesis 27:1-46|Genesis 28:10-22|Genesis 29:1-35|Genesis 32:22-32|Genesis 35:1-15|Genesis 37:1-36|Genesis 46:1-7|Genesis 49:1-33|Hebrews 11:21"
8,Joseph,יוֹסֵף,యోసేపు,He will add,"Ruler of Egypt, saved his family",Genesis 37:3,"Sold by brothers but rose to save them","Joseph's life demonstrates God's sovereignty over evil. As Jacob's favorite son (given the coat of many colors), he was hated by his brothers who sold him into slavery at 17. In Egypt, Potiphar's wife falsely accused him of assault, landing him in prison for years. Yet God gave Joseph the ability to interpret dreams. When Pharaoh had troubling dreams, Joseph interpreted them as seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Made second-in-command at 30, Joseph stored grain that saved Egypt and surrounding nations. When his brothers came for food, Joseph tested then revealed himself, forgiving them: 'You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.' He died at 110, making Israel promise to carry his bones to the Promised Land.","Genesis 37:1-36|Genesis 39:1-23|Genesis 40:1-23|Genesis 41:1-57|Genesis 42:1-38|Genesis 45:1-28|Genesis 50:15-26|Hebrews 11:22"
9,Moses,מֹשֶׁה,మోషే,Drawn out,"Led Israel out of Egypt",Exodus 3:10,"Received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai","Moses is perhaps the most important figure in the Old Testament. Born during Pharaoh's infanticide decree, he was saved when his mother placed him in a basket on the Nile, where Pharaoh's daughter found and raised him. At 40, he killed an Egyptian and fled to Midian for 40 years. God appeared in the burning bush, commissioning him to deliver Israel. Through ten plagues, Moses confronted Pharaoh until the Passover brought deliverance. He parted the Red Sea, received the Ten Commandments on Sinai, and led Israel for 40 years in the wilderness. Despite speaking with God face to face, Moses was forbidden to enter the Promised Land due to striking the rock at Meribah. He died at 120 with undimmed vision, and God Himself buried him.","Exodus 2:1-25|Exodus 3:1-22|Exodus 7-12|Exodus 14:1-31|Exodus 19-20|Numbers 20:1-13|Deuteronomy 34:1-12|Hebrews 11:23-29"
10,Aaron,אַהֲרֹן,అహరోను,High mountain,"First high priest of Israel",Exodus 28:1,"Moses' brother and spokesman","Aaron was Moses' older brother, chosen by God as the first high priest of Israel and Moses' spokesman before Pharaoh. He held up Moses' hands during the battle with Amalek, ensuring Israel's victory. God chose Aaron's family line for the perpetual priesthood, and Aaron wore the sacred garments including the breastplate with twelve stones representing the tribes. However, Aaron had failures - he made the golden calf when Moses delayed on Sinai, and he joined Miriam in criticizing Moses' Cushite wife. When Korah rebelled, Aaron's rod budded, blossomed, and bore almonds overnight, confirming his divine appointment. Aaron died on Mount Hor at 123 years, and his son Eleazar continued the priestly line.","Exodus 4:14-16|Exodus 7:1-10|Exodus 17:8-13|Exodus 28:1-43|Exodus 32:1-35|Numbers 12:1-15|Numbers 16:1-50|Numbers 17:1-13|Numbers 20:22-29|Hebrews 5:1-4"
11,Miriam,מִרְיָם,మిర్యాము,Bitter sea,"Prophetess and sister of Moses",Exodus 15:20,"Led women in praise after Red Sea crossing","Miriam was the elder sister of Moses and Aaron, and the first woman in Scripture called a prophetess. As a young girl, she watched over baby Moses in the basket on the Nile and cleverly suggested their mother as a nurse when Pharaoh's daughter found him. After the miraculous Red Sea crossing, Miriam led the women of Israel in song and dance, playing the tambourine and singing 'Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously!' However, she later spoke against Moses regarding his Cushite wife, perhaps motivated by jealousy. God struck her with leprosy, but Moses interceded and she was healed after seven days outside the camp. Miriam died at Kadesh and was mourned by all Israel.","Exodus 2:1-10|Exodus 15:20-21|Numbers 12:1-16|Numbers 20:1|Micah 6:4"
